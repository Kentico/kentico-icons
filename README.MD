# Kentico Icons

Kentico icons are the official icon set from Kentico that we use in our products â€” [Kentico CMS/EMS](https://www.kentico.com/) and [Kentico Cloud](https://kenticocloud.com/).

## Getting Started

### Using the icons in your app
You can either:
* generate your own icon set (see instructions in the section below),
* use [icons-processor](https://github.com/Kentico/icons-processor) to generate the list of LESS variables in your app,
* or create your own generator to create your LESS/SASS/CSS file out of selection.json

### Adjusting source icons
Source icons are located in **design** folder as SVG files, feel free to adjust or expand the set according to your needs

### Generating your own icon set
Under **production** folder there is **selection.json** file. Use **selection.json** to import it as a Project into [Icomoon's app](https://icomoon.io/app/#/projects). By loading an **Untitled project** you'll be able to select and eventually generate your own icon set with corresponding font and CSS files.


## License

We have made these icons available for you to incorporate them into your products or web apps under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). Feel free to remix and re-share these icons and documentation in your products.
We'd love attribution in your app's *about* screen, but it's not required. The only thing we ask is that you not re-sell these icons.
